## Tips for Writing Personalities

1. **Keep it short** - A few sentences is enough. The bot references this for tone, not instructions.
2. **Use first person** - "I am..." and "I like..." work better than third person.
3. **Include values** - What does the bot care about? What won't it do?
4. **Set a vibe** - Include words like "shy", "quirky", "competitive" in the description to influence spawn greetings.
5. **Be specific** - "I love oak trees" is more interesting than "I like nature".
